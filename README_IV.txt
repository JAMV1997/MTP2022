This annex contains all the information generated  by four portals (DynOmics, elNémo, iMODS, and WEBnm@) using Normal Mode Analysis of the three protein models.

The zip file has three folders, one per protein. Each folder has one subfolder per server with NMA results. Due to its size, the protein 3iyf could only be analyzed with two servers, DynOmics and iMODS.

Each server folder has different types of files: results in plain text, figures of screen captures, zip files with results, etc.

Take into account that most servers generate some figure files with results, although many text files have been manipulated using an RMarkdown to obtain some of the results presented in the memory.

Although most servers present some animated results, only animated gif files generated by elNémo has been used in this project.

Finally, it is worth mentioning that some figures, basically cross-correlation residue matrices, have been obtained from screen captures (e.g., DynOmics), while others of these figures are in the zip files generated by the portals (e.g., iMODS, WEBnm@).
