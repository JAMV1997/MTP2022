This annex contains all the information generated by CHARMM-GUI for running the three protein models analyzed in this project with NAMD. The annex also contains the files (.dcd) created during NAMD simulations.

The zip file has three folders, one per protein model. Each folder contains the zip file generated by CHARMM-GUI and other folder with the input for NAMD and output files from NAMD. Be aware about two aspects:

1 - The configuration file (.namd) used for each protein model is not that generated by CHARMM-GUI, but one edited from the file generated by that portal (.inp)

2 - The zip file generated by CHARMM-GUI contains a lot of information originated during the preparation of the setup. Remember that CHARMM-GUI runs all the phases for a full NAMD simulation except the equilibration and the production phases.
