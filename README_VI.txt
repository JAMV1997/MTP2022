This annex contains all the information related to movies of protein dynamics generated from NAMD files or files generated by the different portals used in this project.

All movies was generated following the same procedure and using VMD:

1 - The dcd files are loaded with the corresponding pdb files in VMD.

2 - The option Movie Maker is used to generate a movie in mpg format (see the instructions in the VMD web site).

3 - The movie format is converted to gif format, which can be loaded in word and powerpoint files.

The zip file contains:

* one folder with VMD scripts required to load the pdb and the dcd files needed to generate the movie

* one zip file with all the files (of two types: pdb and dcd) needed for generating the movies

* one zip file with all the movies in mpg and gif formats

* one word file with all the movies (in gif format) generated for the three proteins.

The first zip file also contains a folder with the gif files generated by elNÃ©mo using NMA for the proteins 1ubq and 1gme. The word file also includes these gif files which are compared to the mobility files obtained with the server DynOmics.
