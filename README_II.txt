This annex contains all the information generated by MDWeb for running two protein models (namely, 1ubq and 1gme) analyzed in this project with NAMD. The annex also contains the files created during NAMD simulations.

The zip file has two folders, one per protein model. Each folder contains the zip files generated by MDWeb and other folder with the input for NAMD and output files from NAMD. Be aware about two aspects:

1 - The configuration file (.namd) used for each protein model is not that generated by MDWeb, but one edited from the file (.in) created by the server.

2 - When the user is interested in a full NAMD setup, MDWeb generates al least three zip files; the first one (root.moby) contains the pdb structure curated by MDWeb, the second zip file contains some information generated during the preparation of the setup, while the third one with the files needed for using NAMD, plus other files that could be used in case of running NAMD in an Unix/Linux environment. Remember that MDWeb runs all the phases for a full NAMD simulation except the production phase. The second and the third files are numbered (f0*.moby) depending of the tasks the user wants to carry out with this server. Note for instance, the different numbering of these zip files in each protein folder. This is, somehow, explained in the screen capture included in the folder for the protein 1ubq. The first zip file has been removed for each protein since it is not needed (the pdb file to be used is that included in the last zip file).
