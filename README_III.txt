This annex contains all the information generated by MDWeb for running two protein models (namely, 1ubq and 1gme) analyzed in this project using a coarse-grained NMA model.

The zip file has two folders, one per protein model. The information contained in each zip file is as follows:

* two figures (.png) with screen captures of the procedure followed with MDWeb

* three zip files (root.moby, f00.moby, f01.moby) with the files generated by MDWeb in each step

* four text files with the values needed to generate four curves: B-factor, Radius of gyration, RMSD per trajectory, RMSD per residue)

* four figures (.png) generated by MDWeb with the previous curves.

The trajectory file for generating a movie from this simulation (f01.moby.dcd) is in the third zip file.
