This annex contains all the information needed to analyze the proteins models saved in the Protein Data Bank and the results generated with NAMD and four portals (DynOmics, elNÃ©mo, iMODS, and WEBnm@) using normal mode analysis (NMA).

The zip file has three folders, one per protein. Each folder contains, beside the RMarkdown, three types of files:

* the pdb files generated by CHARMM-GUI and MDWeb for carrying out NAMD simulations; in the folder corresponding to protein 3iyf there is only one pdb file since MDWeb could not generate any setup for this protein

* all dcd files generated with NAMD, using the setups created by both CHARMM-GUI and MDWeb; remember that for protein 3iyf only one setup (by CHARMM-GUI) could be generated 

* several plain text files created from NMA with the different portals named above.

All files were re-named to avoid confusion and facilitate the reading operation with the RMarkdown. There should not be any problem to recognize the source of all files.

The RMarkdowns of this annex have been written in Spanish.

It is important to mention that some text files were edited: the loading of these files with the corresponding RMarkdown was made assuming that none has a header; therefore, the header was removed in those files where a it was present.

Finally, it is worth mentioning that a word file was created for each protein with results from the analysis of the protein structure and results from calculations with the different tools and servers used in this project. The three word files were merged in a single file. There should be some minor discrepancies between the word file included in this annex and those that could be created with the RMarkdowns; all word files were cooked (before merging) to reduce their sizes and provide a better visualization of results.
